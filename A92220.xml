            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:172335:1"/>
            <head>Reasons and grounds for the necessitie, equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and expediencie of an Excise, to be granted upon the particulars contained herein.</head>
            <p n="1">I. WE would consider the necessitie of raising this Army for defence of our Religion and Liberties, and of contributing to the subsistence of our Army in Ireland.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The money granted by the Loan and Taxt, as also the moneys sent from England being exhausted by the Levie moneyes for foot and horse, and other provision knowne to some of the Counsell of Edinburgh, and may be seen in the particulars to any that shall desire to have satisfaction therein, inforces a necessity of this Kingdome, for contributing to the maintenance of the Army; if the Kingdome of England by their extreme present straits, shall be disabled to provide timously and competently for them according to the treaty.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That in all other Kingdomes necessitate to maintaine armies; the way of Excise after the experience of all other waies, is judged and practised as the most equall, indifferent, solid and just way.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the Parliament in this Kingdome, in the yeare 1640. and the Convention of Estates in July last, being of the same judgement, with the consent of all the Burrowes of Scotland, gave power to the Committees of Estate, for the maintenance of the Armies, to lay on Excises upon all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and all other commodities.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:172335:2"/>V. That the Estates now Conveened again (knowing from the severall Shires and Burghs of the Kingdome, that a new Loane or Taxt upon the same cropt, would be extreme hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie to all men, as well to Burgh as Land, and in speciall to the Commons of Edinburgh; who are (to the regrate of the Committee of Estates) overburdened with the reking out of the Regiment appointed to goe out of Edinburgh) did conceive that an Excise would be far more welcome to them because it much easeth the frugal doth little touch the poore, and lieth most upon the rich and idle spenders superfluously upon their backs and bellies, and so favoureth vertue, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth vice.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That the information spred, will appeare to be most false by the Roll after following; whereby all bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, meal, fishes, all native Commodities necessary for the backe or belly are free, except ale and flesh: and that all wrought com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the crafts at home are free, and all wrought com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; as gloves, saddles, chaires, iron work, &amp;c. impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from abroad to the ruine of the crafts and manifactories at home are to be Excised, which joynd with their freedom from the burden of a new Loan, otherwayes absolutely necessary, and offered by themselves, will be a far greater benefit to the Commons and Crafts, and to every person. And which at the time of the last Parliament they would have bought at a dearer rate, then paying one yeare a placke for a pint of ale.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That seeing God every yeare in his providence, by scarcity and dearth of the victuall, may, and often doth raise the prices of drink and flesh; and seeing the Lords of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and Session, may, and often have altered the prices, and the Magistrates of Burghs every yeare almost doth the same: yea, oftentimes the Ostlers and Taverners at their owne hand, without any warrant from authority, or tumult of the people, doth lay on greater Excises: It is a strange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing to people to grudge at the laying on the same allanerly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172335:2"/> during one yeare for the maintenance of the Cause of God, who in his justice for this grudge, may by dearth lay it on for many yeares, or by the perishing of our Armies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering us and our liberties into the hands of our adversaries, may make us slaves thereunto, and to worse tyrannies both over our souls and bodies.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That this Excise cometh not off the Merchants and sellers, but off the buyers and spenders: That the forraigne Commodities Excised being superfluous, comes off the rich, and not off the poore: That experience sheweth both, that the importers thereof have at their owne hand doubled this Excise, and that notwithstanding thereof, the trade of these superfluities dayly increased to the ruine of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Kingdome: That the fewer superfluities be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, it is the better for the Commons, and the rest of the Kingdome; and the highnesse of their Rate, is many times the mother of frugality: That the exporting of all Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, except coale and salt, (which makes them stay and sell the cheaper at home) is free of Excise; and that for ale and flesh, and other Commodities Excised, wherein the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons may seeme to have any common burden with the rest, it is evident by the Roll, that all in Countrey, or in Citie, payes alike according to the measure of their spending, and that the Nobleman and Gentleman, payes as much for the drinke which he breweth of his ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e malt, in his owne house, for his owne private families use, as is paid in the Taverns: And such like for his owne kyne, and sheep, as is paid in the Markets, that the burden may bee every way equall, and lie rather upon the rich then upon the poore.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That the strictest course that can be advised, will bee resolved upon, for the lifting of it up as exactly in every landward Parish, as in the Burghs; and that in such a way, as may be most beneficiall unto the Publick, without being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172335:3"/> consumed by the charges of Subcollectours: and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver money is gotten thereby, is resolved to be no wayes sent out of the Kingdome, or applied to any private use, but to provide within the Countrey all manner of provisions to be sent unto the Army; and for that end, and during the time of extreme necessity allanerly.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That whereas some may feare the dangerousnesse of the preparative, and apprehend that it will never be removed: They would consider the like objection may be made against the Taxt or Loane, giving in of silver works, and all manner of contributions, and that as the Parliament and Convention gave onely warrant to lay it on for the maintenance of the Army, so they cannot bee presumed to be so disposed, as to desire the continuance of such a burden upon themselves on whom none can impose it or continue it, but themselves; and whether now it bee done or not, if any subsequent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be presumed to be so disposed, the Objectours knowes as well that they may legally do it, as they know that none of the Estates now living and guiding the Kingdome, who have so heartily ventured their lives and fortunes to preserve the liberties of the Kingdome from slavery would ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to it.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. We would seriously ponder that by our Covenant first and last we have sworne unto God to spend our lives and estates in this Cause of Religion, to preserve the Liberties of the Kirk and Kingdome, which mainely consists in the maintenance of the authoritie and dignitie of the supreme Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories thereof, and to promove by all lawfull meanes all such publick resolutions as by them should be found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to so good a cause, and not to suffer our selves to be divided or withdrawne therefrom, or to cast in any let or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to hinder the same, especially seeing the impeders of a publick resolution of the Convention, which shall be taken with the consent of all the rest of the Kingdome, doth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172335:3"/> know what perjurie before God, shame before the world, breach of Treatie to our brethren, destruction to our selves, advantage to the adversaries, and ruine to the cause it would be, if we should suffer this Armie now on foot to dis-band or perish (which God forbid) for want of maintenance: As also how impossible it is for the publick faith, without a publick purse and stocke of credit, to finde provision for them, yet doe both stop this common way taken by all other Nations in the like cases, and thought upon onely here for the present necessity, and showes no other clear way for their subsistance.</p>
